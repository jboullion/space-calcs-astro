Just a place to jot down fun ideas for calculations.

1. Asteroid Impact

-   DO THIS ONE NEXT
-   Have an "Asteroid View" which is viewed from space and shows the asteroid's path and the impact point.
-   -   Can show a multiple meshes to indicate the size of the crater, the ejecta, the fireball, etc.
-   Have a "Planet View" which is viewed from the surface and shows the impact point and the effects of the impact.
-   -   Planet view will basically just be earth. Perhaps we can use a google maps style interface to show the impact.

2. Escape Simulator

-   Basically a fire escape simulation for space stations

3. Game of life
   Basically a grid of cells that can be alive or dead. Each cell can be affected by its neighbors.

Perhaps we could allow users to adjust the rules of the game of life and see how the patterns change.

Maybe we could have different shapes for the grid.

Could a user place blockers to see how the changes the evolution of the grid?

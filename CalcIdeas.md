Just a place to jot down fun ideas for calculations.

1. Game of life
   Basically a grid of cells that can be alive or dead. Each cell can be affected by its neighbors.

Perhaps we could allow users to adjust the rules of the game of life and see how the patterns change.

Maybe we could have different shapes for the grid.

Could a user place blockers to see how the changes the evolution of the grid?

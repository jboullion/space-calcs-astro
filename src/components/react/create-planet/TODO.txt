- Move clouds above water level if it is higher than the surface.
- Add Cloud Seed and Update clouds a little bit. Potentially remove opacity effects from gas

I did notice that it recalls after every change. I'm in asia behind my vpn at the moment and this recalc makes it difficult to utilise.
Could I suggest you put a recalc button on the page so that the user enters all data seamlessly without recalc delays then one calc to create the planet.

-- What does he mean here? Yes it updates after every change, but it seems fairly seemless. Is his VPN causing an issue? I think it SHOULD automatically update, but perhaps he is using a phone?
